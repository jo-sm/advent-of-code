Yet another tricky day. The concept is relatively straightforward - memoize the functions - but I ended up only memoizing `simulate`
and not `nested-length` for a while, which worked but was unnecessarily slow (calling `(simulate 6 256)` took ~300ms but wrapping it in
`nested-length` caused the time to explode to ~60s.

I don't know if it would be possible to avoid the use of `nested-length` and keep a count internal to `simulate` due to the way memoization
works, but it's worth exploring.
